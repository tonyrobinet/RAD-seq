Restriction‚Äêsite Associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq): scripts to find genetic variants in non-model species

This is a cookbook for analyzing RAD-seq raw reads, produced by Illumina, in order to characterize SNPs and INDELs. 
Here the species are two fish, Pollack (Pollachius pollachius, code PPOL) and Red Mullet (Mullus surmuletus, code MSUR).
Their genome are not known, and managers need to know some genetic variants in their population-s for characterizing a probable genetic structure at the population scale.
